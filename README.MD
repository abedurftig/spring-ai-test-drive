# Spring AI Test Drive

I want to get back in the saddle after a few month back from the keyboard. I checked for "Josh Long" on YouTube to see what's the latest in the Java/Spring Boot world. Then I watched the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY6d2SNYeY4); the Devoxx conference talk "Bootiful Spring Boot 3.x by Josh Long".
